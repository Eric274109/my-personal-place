      I started playing the piano when I was 9 years old. I am currently in
      level four and I am learning new sheet music like Fur ELise and Canon in
      D. I have never been in a paino competition so I don't know what it is
      like to play in front of many other people. Other than that, there is not
      much to say.

      These were my two little feathery budgie birds. The yellow one is called
      <b>Sunny</b> and the blue one is called <b>Eke</b> (pronounced 'Ä“kee' or
      'eekee'). I bought them from PetSmart and on the day when I got them, I
      promised myself to take care of them and make sure they are healthy. I
      took care of them for them every day for two years. As I am writing this,
      my little birds are in Heaven. On Feburary 13, 2021 (12:48 AM), Sunny
      crashed into a wall near my door and then accidentally flew into another
      wall near my pc. He walked into the cage and after a while, Sunny suffered
      from a brain injury. Eke liked Sunny very much and suffocated himself to
      be with Sunny. Part of it was my fault. I let them out for way too long
      and worked on my own project. I hope that they are in Heaven now and can
      see what I wrote for them.
