      I have been expermenting with websites since I was in fourth grade, when I got my
      first laptop. At first, I had lot of fun editing text on websites and
      changing color of the words. However, I realized that it wouldn't actually
      teach me much. So, I typed 'coding' and 'programming' into the search bar
      and the first website that caught my eye was Khan Academy. I took me
      almost a year to finish the course. I started to like coding after I
      completed the whole Khan Academy coding course. I kept like coding and
      that explains why I am in this programming class today.

      When I was ten years old, my brother and I created random videos and
      posted them on YouTube. I got bored of it, so I created my own channel,
      which means I have the rights to create whatever I want. I recorded and
      edited videos for around three months, but when I saw I gained no
      subscribers and I needed to do other things, I abondoned that channel.
      However, that doesn't mean I have to abondon my dream too. I have been
      preparing for a long time and I am finally going to create a successful
      channel when I am thirteen (11 more months). I am interested in Minecraft
      and programming so that is probably what I am going to post.

      Minecraft, a world of creativity and building. There endless possiblities
      ranging from cutting down a tree to making a insane mod. That is why I
      like it. I am also learning how to clutch and mlg, and I guess I am pretty
      good at it. I really want to learn how to make mods, so if you have any
      lessons on Java, I will be very happy. If you want my skin, then go into
      chrome dev tools.
