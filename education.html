      I went to Dwight D. Eisenhower Elementary School from 2014 to 2017. I
      don't have much memories to share. Kindergarten was very boring, the only
      fun thing we did was eat cake because of the teacher's birthday. I didn't
      like first grade either, but at very least I learned a little. It was in
      second grade when I started to understand lessons and completed most of my
      homework. Everything changed in third grade when I met my favorite
      teacher. She helped me in writing and arithmetic and eventually, I raised
      my median grade by 30 points.

      After I "graduated" from my elementary school, I went to the upper
      elementary school for grades 4-5. These were the years that I made most of
      my memories in. In fourth grade, I met two nice teachers and they would
      take the time to teach me new things and help me through LAL and math.
      Later, I on moved to fifith grade. My language arts teacher was the best
      teacher in the world. Even though I didn't do well on tests, she boosted
      my scores to get me into advanced class for sixth grade.

      I just completed one grade of middle school so there is not much to tell
      other than that I spent the whole year at home getting A+'s and A's even
      though I didn't paying attention.

      As for high school, I would like to learn at my county's school for
      technology and math. It is kind of like the specialized high schools in
      NY, except they have less questions on the test and is much harder to get
      into (you need straight A+'s).
